# FICO-Homeloan-credit-classification
## Introduction:
This project applies a suite of machine-learning algorithms to an anonymized dataset of real homeowners' Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) applications. The data was used as part of a challenge to create machine-learning models with high accuracy and explainability.

## Objectives:
In this project, we will explore a suite of machine-learning algorithms that can used to develop intelligent credit scoring systems. Particularly, we will explore the following:
- Automated explanatory data analysis using Pandas Profiling.
- Data cleaning using a custom module that utilizes Mahalanobis distance to identify multivariate outliers.
- Feature extraction using factor analysis: 
     - Apply the Kaiser-Mecer-Oikin (KMO) test using a custom function; and
     - Use the Kaiser method to identify the optimal number of factors.
- Framing the credit scoring problem, developing a test harness, and evaluating the baseline model. 
- Exploring a suite of machine learning algorithms.
- Exploring ensemble techniques to enhance performance.
- Selecting the final model and saving to file for deployment
